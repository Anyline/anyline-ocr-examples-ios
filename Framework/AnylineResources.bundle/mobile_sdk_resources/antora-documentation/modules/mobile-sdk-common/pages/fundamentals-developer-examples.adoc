= Working with the Developer Examples

After choosing your technology, explore the Developer Examples (apps with source code) on GitHub. Each repository contains one or two example apps for you to run on a real device, depending on your platform (one each for Android and iOS native, two each for .NET, Cordova, Flutter, and React Native).


.Test on Real Devices
[CAUTION]
====
It's crucial to run the Developer Example Apps on a physical Android or iOS device, as scanning functionality is not supported in the Android Emulator or iOS Simulator.

For Android, the Developer Example Apps can only be built for the _arm_ and _arm64_ architectures. Building for _x86_ and _x86_64_ is not supported.
====

Detailed setup instructions for each platform are available in the respective repository.
