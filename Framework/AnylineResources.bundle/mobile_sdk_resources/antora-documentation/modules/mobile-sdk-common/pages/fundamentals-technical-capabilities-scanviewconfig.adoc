= Technical Capabilities & ScanViewConfig

The Mobile SDK allows to digitize various types of analog data, for which the Mobile SDK contains specialized components to be used. These components are referred to as _Technical Capabilities_.



// .Technical Capabilities included with Mobile SDK
// [%collapsible]
// ====
The following Technical Capabilities are provided by the Mobile SDK. The table below lists the Technical Capability, along with the corresponding Config Type to be used within the ScanViewConfig. A successful result returns the Result Type of the corresponding Config Type.

These Technical Capabilities can be used individually or combined (_composited_), allowing for complex sequential, parallel, or first-to-result (_parallelFirstScan_) workflows.

[NOTE]
====
The configuration of the Mobile SDK requires for at least one of these Technical Capabilities to be present: One _ScanViewConfig_ requires to include one (or more) _PluginConfig_.
